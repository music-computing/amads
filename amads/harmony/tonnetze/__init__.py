Chord-specific transformation functionality that can be
described on "Tonnetze" representations of tonal space.
Most famously, this includes the Tonnetz
described by Euler [1] and later adopted by Riemannian, "neo-Riemannian" scholars, and others.
We then extend this to more recent work by Konstanze Rietsch
whose "Generalising Eulerâ€™s Tonnetz" [2] demonstrated other
"Tonnetze", including with pitches on the edges rather than the vertices.

Normalized Pairwise Variability Index (nPVI).

This module provides functions for calculating the normalized pairwise variability
index (nPVI), a measure used in the analysis of rhythmic variability in music.

    Extracts the normalised pairwise variability index (nPVI).

    The nPVI is a measure of variability between successive elements in a sequence, commonly used
    in music analysis to quantify rhythmic variability. The equation is:

    .. math::

       \text{nPVI} = \frac{100}{m-1} \times \sum\limits_{k=1}^{m-1}
       \left| \frac{d_k - d_{k+1}}{\frac{d_k + d_{k+1}}{2}} \right|

    where :math:`m` is the number of intervals, and :math:`d_k` is the duration of the :math:`k^{th}` interval.

    Args:
        durations (Iterable[float]): the durations to analyse

    Returns:
        float: the extracted nPVI value.

    Examples:
        The first example is taken from Condit-Schultz (2019, Figure 1).

        >>> durs = [1., 1., 1., 1.]
        >>> normalized_pairwise_variability_index(durations=durs)
        0.

        The second example is Daniele & Patel (2013, Appendix).

        >>> durs = [1., 1/2, 1/2, 1., 1/2, 1/2, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, 2., 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, 3/2, 1., 1/2]
        >>> x = normalized_pairwise_variability_index(durations=durs)
        >>> round(x, 1)

"""
The module seeks to find the smallest metrical pulse level (broadly, "tatum")
in response to a source and user tolerance settings.

In the simplest case, a source records its metrical positions exactly,
including fractional values as needed.
We provide functionality for standard, general algorithms in these cases
(greatest common denominator and fraction estimation)
which are battle tested and computationally efficient.

In metrically simple and regular cases like chorales, this value might be
the eighth note, for instance.
In other cases, it gets more complex.
For example, Beethoven's Opus 10 Nr.2 Movement 1 is in 2/4 and from the start includes
a triplet 16ths turn figure in measure 1
(= 12x division, including float approximations of those position as 1.832, 1.916)
and also dotted rhythms pairing a dotted 16th with 32nd note from measure 5
(= 32x division, symbolic float approximation of 5.188).
So to catch these cases in the first 5 measures, we need the
lowest common multiple of 12 and 32, i.e., 96 bins.

In cases of extreme complexity, there may be a "need" for a
considerably greater number of bins per measure (shorter tatum).
This is relevant for some modern music, as well as cases where
grace notes are assigned a specific metrical position/duration
(though in many encoded standards, grace notes are not assigned separate metrical positions).

Moreover, there are musical sources that do not encode fractional time values, but rather approximation with floats.
These include any:
- frame-wise representations of time (including MIDI and any attempted transcription from audio),
- processing via code libraries that likewise convert fractions to floats,
- secondary representations like most CSVs.
As division by 3 leads to rounding, approximation, and floating point errors,
and as much music involves those divisions, this is widely relevant.

The standard algorithms often fail in these contexts, largely because symbolic music
tends to prioritise certain metrical divisions over others.
For example, 15/16 is a commonly used metrical position (largely because 16 is a power of 2), but 14/15 is not.
That being the case, while 14/15 might be a better mathematical fit for approximating a value,
it is typically incorrect as the musical solution.
We can use the term "incorrect" advisedly here because
the floats are secondary representations of a known fractional ground truth.
Doctests demonstrate some of these cases.

    This function serves music that is symbolically encoded in terms of measures,
    with events defined by (or convertable to) measure-start-relative positions
    and with the length of those measures remaining constant.
    It serves use cases including the attempted retrieval of true metrical positions
    from rounded versions thereof (floats).
    See notes at the top of this module, as well as at
    `float_gcd` and `approximate_fraction` for why standard algorithms fail at this task.

    This function serves those common cases where
    there is a need to balance between capturing event positions as accurately as possible while not
    making excessive complexity to account for a few anomalous notes.
    Most importantly, it enables the explicit prioritisation of common pulse divisions.
    Defaults prioritse 16x divsion over 15x, for example.


    Parameters
    ----------
    starts
        Any iterable giving the starting position of events.
        Must be expressed in measure-relative fashion such that
        X.0 is the start of a measure,
        X.5 is the mid-point of a measure, etc.
        Converted to a Counter object if not already in that format.
    pulse_priority_list
        The point of this function is to encode musically common pulse values.
        This argument defaults to numbers under 100 with prime factors of only 2 and 3
        ("3-smooth"), in increasing order.
        The user can define any alternative list, optionally making use of `generate_n_smooth_numbers` for the purpose.
    distance_threshold
        The rounding tolerance between a temporal position multiplied by the bin value and the nearest integer.
        This is essential when working with floats, but can be set to any value the user prefers.
    proportion_threshold
        The proportional number of notes to account for/ignore.
        The default of .999 means that once at least 99.9% of the source's notes are handled, we ignore the rest and bin them.
        This is achieved by iterating through a Counter object ordered from most to least used.

"""
The module seeks to find the smallest metrical pulse level (broadly, "tatum")
in response to a source and user tolerance settings.

In the simplest case, a source records its metrical positions exactly,
including fractional values as needed.
We provide functionality for standard, general algorithms in these cases
(greatest common denominator and fraction estimation)
which are battle tested and computationally efficient.

In metrically simple and regular cases like chorales, this value might be
the eighth note, for instance.
In other cases, it gets more complex.
For example, Beethoven's Opus 10 Nr.2 Movement 1 includes
a triplet 16th turn figure in measure 1
(tatum = 1/6 division of the quarter note)
and also dotted rhythms that pair a dotted 16th with a 32nd note from measure 5
(tatum = 1/8 division of the quarter).
So to catch these cases in the first 5 measures, we need the
lowest common multiple of 6 and 8, i.e., 24 per quarter (or 48 bins per 2/4 measure).

In cases of extreme complexity, there may be a "need" for a
considerably shorter tatum pulse (and, equivalently, a greater number of bins).
This is relevant for some modern music, as well as cases where
grace notes are assigned a specific metrical position/duration
(though in many encoded standards, grace notes are not assigned separate metrical positions).

Moreover, there are musical sources that do not encode fractional time values, but rather approximation with floats.
These include any:
- frame-wise representations of time (including MIDI and any attempted transcription from audio),
- processing via code libraries that likewise convert fractions to floats,
- secondary representations like most CSVs.
As division by 3 leads to rounding, approximation, and floating point errors,
and as much music involves those divisions, this is widely relevant.

The standard algorithms often fail in these contexts, largely because symbolic music
tends to prioritise certain metrical divisions over others.
For example, 15/16 is a commonly used metrical position (largely because 16 is a power of 2), but 14/15 is not.
That being the case, while 14/15 might be a better mathematical fit for approximating a value,
it is typically incorrect as the musical solution.
We can use the term "incorrect" advisedly here because
the floats are secondary representations of a known fractional ground truth.
Doctests demonstrate some of these cases.

    This function serves cases where temporal position values are defined by reference to a constant value.
    Examples include the symbolic time to have elapsed since:
    - the start of a piece (or section) in quarter notes (or some other consistent symbolic value)
    - the start of a measure (or other container), assuming those measures are of a constant duration.

    It serves use cases including the attempted retrieval of true metrical positions (fractions)
    from rounded versions thereof (floats).
    See notes at the top of this module, as well as at
    `float_gcd` and `approximate_fraction` for why standard algorithms fail at this task in a musical setting.

    This function serves those common cases where
    there is a need to balance between capturing event positions as accurately as possible while not
    making excessive complexity to account for a few anomalous notes.
    Most importantly, it enables the explicit prioritisation of common pulse divisions.
    Defaults prioritse 16x divsion over 15x, for example.


    Parameters
    ----------
    starts
        Any iterable giving the starting position of events.
        Must be expressed relative to a reference value such that
        X.0 is the start of a unit,
        X.5 is the mid-point, etc.
    pulse_priority_list
        The point of this function is to encode musically common pulse values.
        This argument defaults to numbers under 100 with prime factors of only 2 and 3
        ("3-smooth"), in increasing order.
        The user can define any alternative list, optionally making use of `generate_n_smooth_numbers` for the purpose.
        See notes at `approximate_fraction_with_priorities`.
        Make sure this list is exhaustive: the function will raise an error if no match is found.
    distance_threshold
        The rounding tolerance between a temporal position multiplied by the bin value and the nearest integer.
        This is essential when working with floats, but can be set to any value the user prefers.
    proportion_threshold
        Optionally, set a proportional number of events notes to account for.
        The default of .999 means that once at least 99.9% of the source's notes are handled, we ignore the rest.
        This is achieved by iterating through a Counter object of values relative to the unit.
        E.g., 1.5 -> 0.5.
        This option should be chosen with care as, in this case,
        only the unit value and equal divisions thereof are considered.

    """
    Builds the Marvin & Laprade (1987) representation of melodic contour
    Given a score of n notes, combcontour will build an n x n matrix of
    ones and zeros. A one is inserted in the i,j-th entry if the pitch
    of note i is higher than the pitch of note j. A zero is inserted 
    otherwise. This matrix is a representation of melodic contour,
    preserving relative rather than specific pitch height info.

        score (Score): The musical score to analyze

        matrix (c): numpy matrix of ones and zeros representing melodic contour

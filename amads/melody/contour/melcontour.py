def melcontour(score: Score, res: float) -> list[tuple[float, int]]:
    """
    Calculates a sequence of the pitches of the last note onset up to 
    each sampling resolution tick
    For instance, given a monophonic score of 4 notes where the notes are sorted
    by onset:
    [note1, note2, note3, note4]

    A sampling resolution of 2.0 will yield:
    [(0.0, note1.keynum), (2.0, note3.keynum)]

    A sampling resolution of 0.5 will yield:
    [(0.0, note1.keynum), (0.5, note1.keynum), (1.0, note2.keynum), ... ]

    Parameters
    ----------
    score 
        Monophonic input score (class from core.basics for storing music scores)
    res
        Sampling resolution (in beats, see core.basics for more details)

    Returns
    -------
    list[tuple[float, float]]
        list of tuples of onset and midi keypitch correspondences

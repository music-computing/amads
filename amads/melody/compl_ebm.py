    Calculate the expectancy-based model of melodic complexity.
    
    This function implements the complexity model from Eerola & North (2000),
    which can analyze either pitch-related components, rhythm-related components,
    or their optimal combination. The output is calibrated against the Essen
    collection (mean=5, std=1).
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    score : Score
        A Score object containing the melody to analyze. The score will be
        flattened and collapsed into a single sequence of notes ordered by
        onset time.
    method : {'p', 'r', 'o'}, optional
        The method to use for complexity calculation:
        - 'p': pitch-related components only
        - 'r': rhythm-related components only
        - 'o': optimal combination (default)
    
    Returns
    -------
    float
        Complexity value calibrated relative to the Essen Collection.
        Higher values indicate higher complexity.
        Returns 0 for empty scores or single notes.

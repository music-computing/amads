"""
Quick overview: The basic hierarchy of a score is shown here.
Each level of this hierarchy can contain 0
or more instances of the next level. Levels are optional,
allowing for more note-list-like representations:

Score (one per musical work or movement)
    Part (one per instrument)
        Staff (usually 1, but e.g. 2 for grand staff)
            Measure (one for each measure)
                (Measure can contain multiple instances of the following)
                Note
                Rest
                Chord
                    Note (one for each note of the chord)
                KeySignature
                TimeSignature

A "flattened" score looks like this:

Score (one per musical work or movement)
    Part (one per instrument)
        Note (no other instances allowed, no ties)

class Pitch:
    """A Pitch represents a symbolic musical pitch. It has two parts:
    The keynum is a number that corresponds to the MIDI convention
    where C4 is 60, C# is 61, etc. The alt is an alteration, where +1
    represents a sharp and -1 represents a flat. Alterations can also
    be, for example, 2 (double-sharp) or -0.5 (quarter-tone flat).
    The symbolic note name is derived by *subtracting* alt from keynum.
    E.g. C#4 has keynum=61, alt=1, so 61-1 gives us 60, corresponding
    to note name C. A Db has the same keynum=61, but alt=-1, and 61-(-1)
    gives us 62, corresponding to note name D. There is no representation
    for the "natural sign" (other than alt=0, which could imply no
    accidental) or "courtesy accidentals."  Because accidentals normally
    "stick" within a measure or are implied by key signatures, accidentals
    are often omitted in the score presentation. Nonetheless, these
    implied accidentals are encoded in the alt field and keynum is the
    intended pitch with the accidental applied.

    Parameters
    ----------
        keynum : float
            MIDI key number, e.g. C4 = 60, generalized to float.

        and optional timing information.

        Parameters
        ----------
        pitches : list of int or list of Pitch
            MIDI note numbers or Pitch objects for each note.
        durations : float or list of float
            Durations for each note. If a scalar value, it will be repeated
            for all notes. Defaults to 1.0 (quarter notes).

        iois : float or list of float or None, optional Inter-onset
            intervals between successive notes. If a scalar value,
            it will be repeated for all notes. If not provided and
            deltas is None, takes values from the durations argument,
            assuming that notes are placed sequentially without overlap.

        deltas : list of float or None, optional
            Start times relative to the melody's start. Cannot be used together
            with iois. If both are None, defaults to using durations as IOIs.

        Returns
        -------
        Score
            A new Score object containing the melody in a single part.
            If pitches is empty, returns a score with an empty part.

        Examples
        --------
        Create a simple C major scale with default timing (sequential quarter notes):

        >>> score = Score.from_melody([60, 62, 64, 65, 67, 69, 71, 72])  # all quarter notes
        >>> notes = score.content[0].content
        >>> len(notes)  # number of notes in first part
        8
        >>> notes[0].pitch.keynum
        60
        >>> score.duration  # last note ends at t=8
        8.0

        Create three notes with varying durations:

        >>> score = Score.from_melody(
        ...     pitches=[60, 62, 64],  # C4, D4, E4
        ...     durations=[0.5, 1.0, 2.0],
        ... )
        >>> score.duration  # last note ends at t=3.5
        3.5

        Create three notes with custom IOIs:

        >>> score = Score.from_melody(
        ...     pitches=[60, 62, 64],  # C4, D4, E4
        ...     durations=1.0,  # quarter notes
        ...     iois=2.0,  # 2 beats between each note onset
        ... )
        >>> score.duration  # last note ends at t=5
        5.0

        Create three notes with explicit deltas:

        >>> score = Score.from_melody(
        ...     pitches=[60, 62, 64],  # C4, D4, E4
        ...     durations=1.0,  # quarter notes
        ...     deltas=[0.0, 2.0, 4.0],  # onset times 2 beats apart
        ... )

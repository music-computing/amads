This music directory is for test examples.
To keep the code distribution small,
music datasets should be in other repos,
and even the individual files here should be short and purposeful.

example.py - provides access to example music files within the package
krn - "kern" aka "humdrum" files (see the README in that directory)
midi - standard midi files
musicxml - MusicXML files

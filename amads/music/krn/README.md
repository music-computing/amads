This is a directory of small krn files for testing
in AMADS and use in the "Keeping Score" book
(https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14938027).

In this case, we have 2 sets of "task" and "reference" pairs for examples used in the Keeping Score book.

1. `happy_birthday_<t/r>` provides a basic example
2. `numberblocks_<t/r>` is an example of more complex rhythmic/metrical patterns.

Thanks to the team at `https://verovio.humdrum.org`, these can be explored and experimented with directly at `https://verovio.humdrum.org/?file={raw_path_to_file}`, so for example:
- Task: https://verovio.humdrum.org/?file=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/music-computing/amads/refs/heads/main/amads/music/krn/numberblocks_task.krn
- Reference: https://verovio.humdrum.org/?file=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/music-computing/amads/refs/heads/main/amads/music/krn/numberblocks_reference.krn
Use cases and more are explained in the book.

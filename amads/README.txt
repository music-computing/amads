This src directory contains the implementation of AMADS.
Subdirectories are:

algorithm - a collection of music analysis algorithms. These
    are the main functions intended for AMADS users.

core - core representation classes and functions.

io - input and output functions to convert standard formats
    such as Standard MIDI Files and MusicXML into the
    AMADS representation.

test - a collection of tests. These tests also illustrate
    how to run most of the analyses offered in AMADS.

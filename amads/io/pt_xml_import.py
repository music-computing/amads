# Partitura seems to have a rounding error, reporting measure length
# of 1919 instead of 1920 when divs per quarter is 480. This can lead
# to measures with fractional duration (e.g. 3.997916666666667) and
# the insertion of ties across measure boundaries that are in the
# wrong place. When DIV_TO_QUARTER_ROUNDING is not None, measure
# durations are rounded to the nearest 1/DIV_TO_QUARTER_ROUNDING of
# a quarter note. Do not round to whole beats because there might
# be a fractional measure with a pickup note. 24 allows for 32nd
# notes and 64th-note triplets (1/24 beat). Rounding must be enabled
# also by passing rnd=True to div_to_quarter(). The intent is to
# round measure boundaries but not note start/duration (because note
# times can be from a MIDI performance, where time is not quantized,
# at least not to symbolic durations or beats.)
#
DIV_TO_QUARTER_ROUNDING = 96

# algorithm: multiple passes over iter_all()
# for each part: add the part to a Concurrence
#      1st pass: get staff numbers from notes, extract measures, get div/qtr
#           create a Concurrence of staves if more than one,
#           create measures in each staff
#           build a map from every 10 beats to the Staff content index of a
#               measure that starts after that time. (to make it fast to find
#               measures - see description below)
#      2nd pass: get notes, rests, insert parameters into lists
#      3rd pass: re-tie notes that cross measures in case the measure boundary
#           has moved due to rounding
#      4th pass: build Note and Rest objects, insert into Measures
# measure_map: a list of indices into the Staff content list such that for any
#     time t, staff.content[measure_map[int(t/10)]].onset <= t and
#     staff.content[measure_map[int(t/10) + 1]].onset > t. Intuitively,
#     we find index i = int(t/10), and we're guaranteed that measure indexed by
#     measure_map[i] starts at or before time t. We can then search forward to
#     find the measure that contains t.
# Besides the measures map, we have a map pt_note_to_note from partitura note id
#     to both events and Note objects (as a list [event, note]) so we can find
#     the notes to adjust when we process ties.

"""
pm_midi_import.py

Import MIDI files into AMADS Score structure using the PrettyMIDI library.

Functions
---------
- pretty_midi_midi_import(filename: str, flatten: bool = False,
                          collapse: bool = False, show: bool = False) -> Score:
    Imports a MIDI file using PrettyMIDI and converts it into a `Score` object.

Usage
-----
Do not use this module directly; see readscore.py.

Notes
-----
PrettyMIDI has a "hidden" representation of teh MIDI tempo track in
`_tick_scales`, which has the form [(tick, tick_duration), ...]. We
need to convert this to a TimeMap.

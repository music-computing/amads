# Core Data Structures

Quick overview: The basic hierarchy of a score is shown here. Each level
of this hierarchy can contain 0 or more instances of the next level.
There are two representations: a "full" score retains most of the
structure of Western classical notation, while a "flattened" score is
a more abstracted representation emphasizing notes.

## Full Scores

A "full" score looks like this:

<div style=margin-left:2em;"><b>Score</b> - one per musical work or movement </div>

<div style=margin-left:4em;"><b>Part</b> - one per instrument </div>

<div style=margin-left:6em;"><b>Staff</b> - usually 1, but e.g. 2 for grand staff</div>
<div style=margin-left:8em;"><b>Measure</b> - one for each measure. Each measure can
contain multiple instances of the following: </div>
<div style=margin-left:10em;"><b>Note</b></div>
<div style=margin-left:10em;"><b>Rest</b></div>
<div style=margin-left:10em;"><b>Chord</b></div>
<div style=margin-left:12em;"><b>Note</b> - one for each note of the chord</div>
<div style=margin-left:10em;"><b>KeySignature</b></div>
<div style=margin-left:10em;"><b>TimeSignature</b></div>
<div style=margin-left:10em;"><b>Clef</b></div>

## Flattened Scores

A "flattened" score looks like this:

<div style=margin-left:2em;"><b>Score</b> - one per musical work or movement</div>
<div style=margin-left:4em;"><b>Part</b> - one per instrument</div>
<div style=margin-left:6em;"><b>Note</b> - no other instances allowed, no ties</div>

## Well-Formed Scores

Score structure is not enforced (it is up to the developer), but AMADS
functions expect well-formed scores in either of the "full" score or
the "flattened" score forms shown above.

A well-formed score will have events belonging to a parent (EventGroup)
in time order.

Rests objects are created when scores are read from MusicXML, but MIDI
has no representation for rests and the MIDI file reader does not insert
Rest objects. Generally, you should ignore Rests since Notes all have
`onset`s. Rests are not needed for timing.

### Tempo, Time, Duration

Time is usually measured in "quarters". ("Beat" is avioded since it
is often ambiguous \-- how many beats per measure are in 6/8 time?) Time
can also be measured in real-time units of seconds.

Tempo is indicated at the score level as a single mapping between
seconds and quarters.

You can convert every time and duration in an entire score from quarters
to seconds (and vice versa), allowing you to work in musical time or
real time. (See
`~amads.core.basics.Score.convert_to_seconds()`{.interpreted-text
role="py:meth"} or
`~amads.core.basics.Score.convert_to_quarters()`{.interpreted-text
role="py:meth"}.

### Events and EventGroups

To implement this hierarchical representation, we have an abstract
superclass, which is `~amads.core.basics.Event`{.interpreted-text
role="py:class"}. Every Event has the following attributes:

> `onset`
> :   (float) The time of the event
> 
> `duration`
> :   (float) The duration (in beats or seconds) of the event
> 
> `parent`
> :   (EventGroup) The object containing this event
> 
> `info`
> :   a dictionary with (optional) additional information

Anything that can be a `parent` is an
`~amads.core.basics.EventGroup`{.interpreted-text role="py:class"}.
EventGroups including Part, Staff, Measure and Chord are also children,
so you would also expect them to be Events. There is no conflict because
EventGroup *inherits from* Event. Everything is an Event! But not every
Event is an EventGroup.

### Onset Times

Onset times (as either quarters or seconds) are *zero-based* and
*absolute*. Two measures of quarter notes in 4/4 time will have `onsets`
of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Note that the downbeat is *not* 1, and the
first beat of the second measure is 4, not 0 or 1.

Finally, `onset` can be None during the construction of a Score. If the
`onset` is None and a Note (Event) is appended to the Events in a
Measure (EventGroup), the `onset` of the Note is set so that the Events
are sequential in time. This can be a convenience when writing
expressions like `Measure(Note(), Note(), Rest(), Note())`, but *we
recommend that you always specify onset times*.

### The Note Class

The most important class is `~amads.core.basics.Note`{.interpreted-text
role="py:class"}. In addition to [onset]{.title-ref},
[duration]{.title-ref} and [parent]{.title-ref}, inherited from Event, a
Note has

> `pitch`
> :   (Pitch) A pitch object (see below)
> 
> `dynamic`
> :   (optional int or str) dynamic (loudness) level
> 
> `lyric`
> :   (optional str) lyric text
> 
> `tie`
> :   (optional Note) the Note this Note is tied to, if any


### Pitches

Pitches are complex enough to get their own class (an integer will not
do). The pitch class has these attributes:

> `key_num`
> :   (float) MIDI-like key number, e.g. C4 = 60
> 
> `alt`
> :   (float) Alteration, e.g. one flat = -1


Notice that you can always ignore `alt` and just use `key_num`, but if
you care about note spelling, you will need `alt`.

Notice also that both `key_num` and `alt` are floats, so you can express
quarter tones (a quarter tone above C4 is represented by 60.5), and the
`alt` would be 0.5 (a quarter tone sharp).

The Pitch class has a wealth of properties to obtain the name as a
string, the octave, pitch class, and others.

### Immutable Scores (Mostly)

In general, AMADS Scores are immutable, which means you cannot (or
should not) change them. When you need changes (consider simple
operations like time-stretching a score or transposing or removing all
but one instrument), AMADS almost always returns a *copy*, leaving the
original intact. The goal is to avoid surprising side effects when the
same score is passed through different operations and analyses.

There are important exceptions. Some examples:

-   `~amads.core.basics.Score.convert_to_seconds()`{.interpreted-text
    role="py:meth"} or
    `~amads.core.basics.Score.convert_to_quarters()`{.interpreted-text
    role="py:meth"} change the score (but either operation can be undone
    by calling the other),
-   it is permissible to "annotate" a score by adding new information,
    e.g., setting new attributes to the Events\' `info`.
-   during construction, when there is only one reference to a Score, it
    is normal to modify the score by inserting new events.

You should **never** modify a Pitch. Always construct a new one, because
when Notes are copied, the new Note *shares* the original Note\'s Pitch
object. Assigning to `pitch.key_num` might change the `pitch` of many
other notes.

### Accessing and Processing Scores

If you access notes directly, be aware that notes can be tied: Not every
Note object represents a new performed tone. Also, Measures can contain
Chord events that contain Notes, so Notes can exist at two levels of the
hierarchy. Because of these and other complications, it is recommended
that you use Score methods to extract the information you need rather
than using your own code to traverse a Score.

To process all notes in time order, call the Score method
`~amads.core.basics.Score.get_sorted_notes`{.interpreted-text
role="py:meth"}, which returns a flat list of all notes, ordered by
onset time, with ties merged.

If you need notes from a particular staff or part, use
`~amads.core.basics.Score.collapse_parts`{.interpreted-text
role="py:meth"} to obtain a score with only the desired information, and
then apply `~amads.core.basics.Score.get_sorted_notes`{.interpreted-text
role="py:meth"} to get the Notes.

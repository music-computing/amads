Contributing
============

We welcome contributions to the project! Whether you want to fix bugs, improve documentation, or add new features, here's how you can contribute:

1. Submit a pull request
-----------------------

Fork the repository and create a pull request with your changes. Your contribution can be:

- Bug fixes
- Documentation improvements
- New features and functionality
- Test cases

2. Continuous Integration
------------------------

All pull requests must pass our automated test suite in the CI pipeline before they can be merged. This ensures code quality and prevents regressions.

3. Code Review
-------------

A project maintainer will review your code. They may request changes or clarification. This helps maintain code quality and consistency.

4. Merging
----------

Once your pull request passes CI and receives approval from a reviewer, it can be merged into the main codebase.

We aim to review pull requests promptly and provide constructive feedback. Thank you for helping improve the project!

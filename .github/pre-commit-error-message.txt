Pre-commit checks failed! If you are seeing this message, you probably forgot to install the pre-commit hooks on your local machine. To fix this, run the following in your terminal:

pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install

Next time you commit, pre-commit will run automatically, and will fix or flag any issues.
To see all issues without committing, you can run:

pre-commit run --all-files

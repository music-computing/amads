# Things that we want to be able to do:
#
# Compute cross-entropy for a sequence; i.e. tells us how well the model
# predicts the sequence overall.
#
# Compute note-level log probability for a sequence; i.e. tells us how well
# the model predicts each token. We expect this to correspond somewhat to the
# listener's experience of surprise.
#
# For each token, compute the entropy of the model's predictions for that token.
# That tells us about the model's uncertainty about the token.
#
## Further questions:
#
#Â Moment-to-moment learning - can we quantify how much the model is learning
# as it progresses through a sequence? There are some ideas that this is
# related to the reward people get from listening to music.
# To implement this, we need to think about predict_sequence; maybe it's not
# just predicting but also updating the model.

# Toolkit

This is an experiment to see if there's interest in gathering a toolkit of algorithms and resources from published literature on computational processes for symbolic music.

## Remit 

The focus is on _symbolic_ music.
Naturally, there is overlap with audio (many algorithms apply to both)
but a lot more of this kinds of material out there for audio and signal processing.

## Philosophy

- Python, for all the usual reaons ;)
- Minimial dependencies / imports:
  - `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` and nothing else.
- Maximally modular and interoperable:
  - wherever possible, scripts are stand-alone, fully modular functions to use independently and/or recombine as needed.
  - this enables users to "cherry pick" the bits they need.

## Uses

Any!
... including pedagogical implementation tasks.
Workspaces are provided for that reason as both `.py` and notebook (`.ipynb`).

## Structure

- High-level separation of `algorithms`, `resources`, `tests`
- Within that, separation by paramater and operation, e.g., `melody-contour`.

## Contributions

... are welcome! Please pitch in relevant material, making sure to include the relevant citation.

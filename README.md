# Toolkit

This is a toolkit of algorithms and resources from published literature on computational processes for symbolic music.

## Remit 

The focus is on _symbolic_ music.
Naturally, there is overlap with audio (many algorithms apply to both).
and 

## Philosophy

- Minimial dependencies / imports:
  - `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` and nothing else.
- Maximally modular and interoperable:
  - most scripts comprise entirely stand-alone, fully modular functions to recombine as needed.
  - this enables users to cherry pick the bits they need.

## Structure

- High-level separation of `algorithms`, `resources`, `tests`
- Within that, serparation by paramater and operation, e.g., `melody-contour`.

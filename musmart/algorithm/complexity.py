def lz77(sequence: np.array, window_size: int = 64) -> int:
    """Applies the LZ77 compression algorithm to a discrete `sequence` and returns length of the compressed string

    Here we calculate the complexity of a discrete `sequence` (could be pitch classes, binned inter-onset intervals)
    by converting it into a string representation, compressing using LZ77 [1], then calculating the length of the
    compressed string as in [2]. Higher values mean that more information is required to represent the sequence and
    thus greater complexity.

    Arguments:
        sequence (np.array): a discrete sequence, could be pitch classes, inter-onset intervals, etc...
        window_size (int, optional): the size of the sliding window to use in LZ77 calculation, defaults to 64

    Returns:
        int: the length of the compressed string

    Examples:
        NB. some examples are taken from https://timguite.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/03/15/lz77-in-python.html

        >>> lz77(np.array(["a"]))
        1

        >>> lz77(np.array(["a", "b", "a"]))
        3

        >>> testme = "word word"
        >>> lz77(np.array(list(testme)))    # i.e., np.array(["w", "o", "r", "d", " ", "w", "o", "r", "d"])
        6

        >>> lz77(np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.1]))    # works with numeric values as well
        1

def lz77_size(sequence: Iterable[Hashable], window_size: int = 64, proportional: bool = False) -> Union[int, float]:
    """
    Applies the LZ77 compression algorithm to a discrete `sequence` and returns the length of the compressed string.

    Here we calculate the complexity of a discrete `sequence` (could be pitch classes, binned inter-onset intervals)
    by converting it into a string representation, compressing using LZ77 [1], then calculating the length of the
    compressed string as in [2]. Higher values mean that more information is required to represent the sequence,
    indicating greater complexity.

    Currently, only sequences with fewer than 96 unique elements are supported.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sequence : np.ndarray
        A discrete sequence, which could be pitch classes, inter-onset intervals, etc.

    window_size : int, optional
        The size of the sliding window to use in LZ77 calculation. Default is 64.

    proportional : bool, optional
        If True, the complexity is expressed with respect to the size of the input such that 1.0 means the input
        cannot be compressed (i.e., maximum possible complexity). Default is False.

    Returns
    -------
    int | float
        The length of the compressed string, either in `raw` form (int) or wrt. input sequence length (float)

    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If the input contains more than 96 unique elements.

    Examples
    --------
    NB: Some examples are taken from https://timguite.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/03/15/lz77-in-python.html

    >>> lz77_size(["a"])
    1

    >>> lz77_size(["a", "b", "a"])
    3

    >>> testme = "word word"
    >>> lz77_size(list(testme))  # i.e., np.array(["w", "o", "r", "d", " ", "w", "o", "r", "d"]))
    6

    >>> lz77_size([0.1, 0.2, 0.1])  # Works with numeric values as well
    3

    >>> lz77_size([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3])
    6

    >>> lz77_size(range(1000))  # doctest: +IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    NotImplementedError: Currently only sequences with fewer than 95 unique elements are supported.

# basics.py - basic symbolic music representation classes
"""
Quick overview: The basic hierarchy of a score is shown here.
Each level of this hierarchy can contain 0
or more instances of the next level. Levels are optional,
allowing for more note-list-like representations:

Score (one per musical work or movement)
    Part (one per instrument)
        Staff (usually 1, but e.g. 2 for grand staff)
            Measure (one for each measure)
                (Measure can contain multiple instances of the following)
                Note
                Rest
                Chord
                    Note (one for each note of the chord)
                KeySignature
                TimeSignature

A "flattened" score looks like this:

Score (one per musical work or movement)
    Part (one per instrument)
        Note (no other instances allowed, no ties)

    represents a sharp and -1 represents a flat. Alterations can also
    be, for example, 2 (double-sharp) or -0.5 (quarter-tone flat).
    The symbolic note name is derived by *subtracting* alt from keynum.
    E.g. C#4 has keynum=61, alt=1, so 61-1 gives us 60, corresponding
    to note name C. A Db has the same keynum=61, but alt=-1, and 61-(-1)
    gives us 62, corresponding to note name D. There is no representation
    for the "natural sign" (other than alt=0, which could imply no
    accidental) or "courtesy accidentals."  Because accidentals normally
    "stick" within a measure or are implied by key signatures, accidentals
    are often omitted in the score presentation. Nonetheless, these
